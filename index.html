           This soul pacifying  teaching has been imparted to the restless world by Lord Krishna in the battlefield of Mahabharata. He is stuck to his promise even today. In the era of TRETA he was born as Lord Rama to Dasharatha, in the Dwaparyug, he was the son of Vasudev, he is called Lord Krishna and in the Kalyug, i.e  the present era, he is the son of Dharma, Lord Shree Swaminarayan. Lord Shree Swami Narayan Left his house when he was eleven and bore the name Neelkanth. He set out for the pilgrimages. He moved to  all pilgrimages in India. He destroyed the inequalities and established the cult there. This is because of Lord Neelkanth Varni that  the religion could regain its form to prevail it for a long time vigorously. Lord Swaminarayan focused on three elements. Firstly the spiritual teachings of Vyasji .He abridged the teachings of Vyasji so that a layman could understand it easily. Secondly, he decided to reach the teachings of Vyasji to every house. He prepared a large number of disciples who renounced the world and moved from village to village to spread his preachments. Thirdly, more importantly, he encompassed temples. He connected the temples to the teachings of Vyasji. His deciples and followers got a clear picture of their religion. He presented the conditions for the people in a book which is an order for his disciples. He mentioned in the book that free education is the greatest of all the alms. Lord Swaminarayan focused on the education of such kind which gives the students a salvation. </p>
